[Here's a link to the repo](https://github.com/ebrinz/next-lander)

It's meant for an easily configurable markdown blog hosted on Netlify. Each card on this page is a seperate markdown file.
With Netlify, every time you push a new md file to your repo, it redeploys the site with the new content.

Clone it, add some content using the example data as a template.

Netlify is just desiged to work well with the framework this blog is built in, Next.js.

Netlify is so free for some reason, you dont even have to put your credit card info in to get your new blog hosted!
