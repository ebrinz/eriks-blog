After learning a bit about the Linux environment recently, one thing kept popping up that caught my eye. What are daemons, and why are they called daemons? It turns out it refers to a theory on information developed by James Maxwell in 1867.


[wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon)


Here's a cool youtube on the topic:

So, now there's this occult allegory embedded deep in the design of the Linux OS - which I find fascinating. Thinking a bit deeper on the topic, I'm seeing a larger allegory of a cosmogeny in reference to the entire system.

Given power, the system begins with the bootloader, which turns on the kernal, which fires up the daemons, and the dameons go about doing their little jobs - turning on things, or waiting for orders. And finally, the userspace opens to allow a human to interact with the system. Now I'm not an expert here so dont bare with me if I'm butchering this boiled down description.

There's a point of conception when powering on the system. From nothing there was something.

There's primordial stage during bootloading. Many creation myths have a primordial stage where the greater gods give birth to the sun and moon... or the kernal.

The kernal is this sort of prime god figure that births the daemons.

The daemons are these little lesser gods, sort of like angels or titans. For instance the cron daemon in charge of scheduling jobs is in fact named after, maybe not directly, Cronos the god of time.

There is even an abyss where you empty your files never to return again, /dev/null.

Then there is a heirarchy of users controlled by permissions in which they can interact with this little universe to do their bidding.

So I get a kick out of the fact that every time you send power your computer, you conceive a small universe, or at least command its reanimation from storage.

Then I ask myself, could not we be so different?
