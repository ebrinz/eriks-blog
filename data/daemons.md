### Information theory and cosmogony

After learning a bit about the Linux environment, one thing kept popping up that caught my eye. What are daemons, and why are they called daemons? It turns out it refers to a theory on information developed by James Maxwell in 1867.

Here's a cool youtube on the topic:

So, now there's this occult allegory embedded deep in the design of the Linux OS - which I find fascinating. But to me, it doesnt end there. Thinking a bit deeper on the topic, I find a larger allegory of a cosmogeny in reference to the entire system.

Given power, the system begins with the bootloader, which turns on the kernal, which fires up the daemons, and the dameons go about doing their little jobs - turning on things, or waiting for orders. An finally the userspace opens to allow human interaction with the system. Now I'm not an expert here so dont bare with me if I'm butchering this boiled down description.

As a fan of mythology, I can't help but overlay the idea of a tiny universe which a root user has comand over.

First there was power, the primordial conception - or big bang.
