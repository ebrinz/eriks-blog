[Here's a link to the repo](https://github.com/ebrinz/ufo-report-scraper)

This is meant to be a fun dataset to practice data wrangling and munging.

Currently only pulling raw data from the site, but expectations are to cleanse data and run natural language processing for aggregation.

A lot of possibitlities here.


“I'm frequently asked, "Do you believe there's extraterrestrial intelligence?" I give the standard arguments- there are a lot of places out there, the molecules of life are everywhere, I use the word billions, and so on. Then I say it would be astonishing to me if there weren't extraterrestrial intelligence, but of course there is as yet no compelling evidence for it.
Often, I'm asked next, "What do you really think?"
I say, "I just told you what I really think."
"Yes, but what's your gut feeling?"
But I try not to think with my gut. If I'm serious about understanding the world, thinking with anything besides my brain, as tempting as that might be, is likely to get me into trouble. Really, it's okay to reserve judgment until the evidence is in.” - Carl Sagan
